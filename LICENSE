      contents of the database;

      database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its 
      individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of

5. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

      and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the 
      Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This

      on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or 
      otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, 
      punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising 
      out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the 
      Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, 
      expenses, or damages.

   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
      shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most 
      closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

      Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public 
      License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under 
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
      1) automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is 
         cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
      2) upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
